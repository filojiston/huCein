# huCein

OH NO!! Javascript is everywhere! We need somebody to STOP THIS MADNESS!!  
**WELL I HEAR YOU!!**  
Hi, i am huCein. I am the one who will finish this!

## Gameplay

You will be playing as huCein, an extraordinary C programmer. He can shoot C's  
on top of his head. His duty is, well, there is JS's raining out there. He must shoot
those JS's with his C's.  
Yep, thats pretty much it.

## Compiling Source Code

You'll need SDL2, SDL_ttf and SDL_image libraries in order to compile this game.  
After that, compile it with your favourite cpp compiler. I've used g++. Here is my
compilation command:

```bash
g++ src\*.cpp -o husgame -g -ID:\sources\include -Iincludes -LD:\sources\lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_image -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -Wall -Werror
```

I've used windows for building this game, so yours can be a little bit different than mine.
After compilation, just run the executable **husgame** (thats my executable name).

## Inputs

    - Left & Right arrow keys (←, →) for moving huCein
    - Spacebar for shooting C's
    - P key for pausing the game

## Important Note

This game is made to joke among friends. By no means it is not intented to offend any javascript programmer.  
I personally love to writing code in javascript. Just for make things clear.  
Also, feel free to improve the code or add new things to it. I am fully open to any kind of advice.
